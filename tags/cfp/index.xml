      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on the TPC for WiSec, and the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://wisec2017.ccs.neu.edu/call-for-papers-posters-demos.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;call for papers&lt;/a&gt; has been released:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACM WiSec is the leading ACM and SIGSAC conference dedicated to all aspects of security and privacy in wireless and mobile networks and their applications. In addition to the traditional ACM WiSec topics of physical, link, and network layer security, we welcome papers focusing on the security and privacy of mobile software platforms, usable security and privacy, biometrics, cryptography, and the increasingly diverse range of mobile or wireless applications such as Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems. The conference welcomes both theoretical as well as systems contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, there are a couple of interesting formats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full and short papers (12/6 pages ACM format)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opinion papers (3 pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproducibility label (for results reproduced by third party)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WiSec also solicits submission of posters and demos.&lt;/li&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tippenhauer.de/post/cfp-sems-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on the TPC of SEMS 2017, held in between with IEEE S&amp;amp;P and EUROCRYPT 2017 in Paris. The CfP was just released. More info 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://sems2017.cs.ru.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded and mobile devices that provide security and crypto functionalities, and manage private and confidential data are omnipresent in our daily lives. Examples of such devices range from smart cards and RFID tags, to mobile phones, tablets, and IoT devices. Ensuring the security and privacy of these devices is a challenging problem, as witnessed by recent breaking of crypto and security systems used in mobile phones, car keys, and RFID-enabled cards. Typical threats to extract the keys include side-channel and fault analysis. Additionally, the vulnerabilities of the devices imply also privacy concerns. The operating systems supporting some of those devices, particularly mobile phones and tablets, but also IoT ones, have become very complex. Various sorts of malware present a constant threat for users. Although measures like application sandboxing take place, they also open the court for new attacks by constantly collecting and organizing sensitive information about the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting novel research results on the following topics of interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Security architectures for embedded and mobile systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Physical (side-channel and fault) attacks on embedded and mobile systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hardware security of mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– (mobile) Malware detection and prevention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Machine learning applications to highlight possible threats to user privacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Privacy-preserving issues for mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Secure localization and location privacy for mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Security and privacy in the Internet of Things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Secure execution environments (e.g., TrustZone, TPMs) on mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Sensor spoofing attacks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-day workshop will include presentation of peer-reviewed papers and two renowned keynote speakers, Prof. Srdjan Capkun (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) and Prof. Bart Preneel (KU Leuven, Belgium).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepted papers will be published by IEEE as the proceedings in “IEEE EuroS&amp;amp;P Workshops”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submission deadline: 17 December 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notification: 20 January 2017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera-ready submission: 13 February 2017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop: 30 April 2017&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of large-scale interconnected systems of heterogeneous components interacting with their physical environments. There are a multitude of CPS devices and applications being deployed to serve critical functions in our lives. The security of CPS becomes extremely important. This workshop will provide a platform for professionals from academia, government, and industry to discuss how to address the increasing security challenges facing CPS. Besides invited talks, we also seek novel submissions describing theoretical and practical security solutions to CPS. Papers that are pertinent to the security of embedded systems, SCADA, smart grid, and critical infrastructure networks are all welcome, especially in the domains of energy and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submission deadline is December 1. CPSS will be held in conjunction with ACM AsiaCCS’17
Abu Dhabi, UAE, April 2, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started in 2005, RFIDsec has become the premier venue devoted to security and privacy of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The nature of radio-enabled item identification and automatic data capture has significantly changed overthe years driven by the interest in overarching applications such as the Internet-of-Things and cyber-physical systems. As such, RFIDsec has also broadened its scope and seeks papers describing any contributions to security and privacy in any application area related to any constrained wireless devices, such as sensor nodes, smart wearables, contactless smart cards, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and RFID tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on the TPC for the 2nd ACM Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop. Its CfP was just released, more details 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://icsd.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/cpss16/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Deadline for paper submissions is December 5, 2015. From the CfP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of large-scale interconnected
systems of heterogeneous components interacting with their
physical environments. There are a multitude of CPS devices and
applications being deployed to serve critical functions in our
lives. The security of CPS becomes extremely important. This
workshop will provide a platform for professionals from academia,
government, and industry to discuss how to address the increasing
security challenges facing CPS. Besides invited talks, we also
seek novel submissions describing theoretical and practical
security solutions to CPS. Papers that are pertinent to the
security of embedded systems, SCADA, smart grid, and critical
infrastructure networks are all welcome, especially in the domains
of energy and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
