Papers rejected at the first round can be submitted at the second round, together with a response letter addressing the reviewer\u0026rsquo;s points.\nConference Topics Areas of interest for ACNS 2021 include but are not limited to:\n Access control Applied cryptography Automated security analysis Biometric security/privacy Blockchain and cryptocurrencies Cloud security/privacy Complex systems security Critical infrastructure security Cryptographic primitives Cryptographic protocols Data protection Database/system security Digital rights management Email, app and web security Future Internet security Human factors in security Identity management IP protection Internet fraud, cybercrime Internet-of-Things (IoT) security Intrusion detection Key management Malware Mobile/wireless/5G security Network security protocols Privacy/anonymity, PETs Security/privacy metrics Side channel attacks (e.g., microarchitectural, physical-layer) Trust management Ubiquitous security/privacy Usable security/privacy  Submission Instructions Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to any other venue with formally published proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose. Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgement or obvious references. Each submission must begin with a title and short abstract. The introduction should summarise the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. All submissions must follow the original LNCS format (see http://www.springeronline.com/lncs​ ) with a page limit of 20 pages (incl. references) for the main part (reviewers are not required to read beyond this limit) and 30 pages in total. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format. Papers rejected at the first round can be submitted at the second round (together with a response letter). Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. We encourage submissions in LaTeX. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference and must make a full version of their paper available online. Note that the page limit for camera-ready version is 20 pages with up to 10 additional pages of Appendix.\nConflicts of Interests We use the following definition on conflicts of Interest, based on Usenix Security’20: The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest. This includes: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past, (3) anyone the author has collaborated or published with in the prior two years, (4) anyone who is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds your research, or (5) close personal friendships. For other forms of conflict, authors must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. Program committee members who are in conflict of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of the paper by default.\nOrganizing Committee General Co-Chairs  Chunhua Su, University of Aizu, Japan Kauzma Omote, University of Tsukuba, Japan  Program Co-Chairs  Kazue Sako, Waseda University, Japan Nils Ole Tippenhauer, CISPA, Germany  Publicity Chair Keita Emura, NICT, Japan\nWorkshop Chair Jianying Zhou, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore\nPoster Chair Masaki Shimaoka, University of Tsukuba/SECOM CO., LTD., Japan\nProgram Committee  Mitsuaki Akiyama, NTT, Japan Cristina Alcaraz, University of Malaga, Spain Man Ho Au, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Lejla Batina, Radboud Universiteit, Netherlands Alex Biryukov, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg Alexandra Boldyreva, Georgia Tech, USA Ferdinand Brasser, TU Darmstadt, Germany Chris Brzuska, Aalto University, Finland Alvaro Cardenas, University of California at Santa Clara, USA Sudipta Chattopadhyay, SUTD, Singapore Xiaofeng Chen, Xidian University, China Liqun Chen, University of Surrey, UK Jiska Classen, TU Darmstadt, Germany Hervé Debar, Télécom SudParis, France Stéphanie Delaune, IRISA, France Christian Doerr, TU Delft, Netherlands Nico Döttling, CISPA, Germany F.

It provides a ranking of journals and conferences in different fields, and uses the h5 metric, \u0026ldquo;the number n of papers that were released in the last 5 years, and had at least n citations\u0026rdquo;. Konrad Rieck\u0026rsquo;s list of Normalized Top-100 Security Papers provides a great alternative ranking of important classic papers in the field.\nBased on the h5 metric, the following ranking for security conferences and journals is generated here:\n  ACM Symposium on Computer and Communications Security (88, +6)  IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (86, +6 and +1 position)  USENIX Conference on Security (80, -1 position)  IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (74)  Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) (71, +6)  Annual International Conference on Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT) (61, +5)  Computers \u0026amp; Security (59, +9 and +1 position)  IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (54, +7)  International Conference on Cryptology (CRYPTO) (52, -2 positions)  International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security (46)  International Conference on The Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (ASIACRYPT) (42)  Security and Communication Networks (40, +1 position)  Theory of cryptography (38)  ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS) (37)  Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS) (35, new in the list)  IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroSNP) (34, +8, new in top 20)  Designs, Codes and Cryptography (34)  European Conference on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) (34)  IEEE Security \u0026amp; Privacy (31)  Journal of Information Security and Applications (31, new in list)  Some other honourable mentions where I published before, am involved, or consider submitting:\n  Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (INFOCOM) (72)  Computer Networks (56)  Annual International Conference on Mobile computing and networking (Mobicom) (48)  International Conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services (MOBISYS) (44)  International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) (32)  ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) (30, but only small security track)  Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (29)  Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) (29)  International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography (29)  IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) (29)  ACM conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY) (28)  Journal of Cryptology (28)  International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) (26)  International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES) (24)  Wireless Network Security (WISEC) (23)  Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID) (22)  Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS) (21)  IEEE International Conferences on Internet of Things, and Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) (20)  IFIP TC 11 International Conference on ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection (IFIP Sec) (17)  IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium, (HASE) (16)  Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) (14)  Network and Systems Security (NSS) (13)  Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM) (13)  Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm) (12)  There are some interesting observations I made from the ranking (updated from last iteration):\n The h5 index of the top venues increased by about 5-9 points, without major changes in order (TIFS rose to position 2). For these tier 1 venues, this is definitely expected, as the number of submissions/accepted papers has increased significantly in the last 10 years. Our ProfilIoT paper at SAC\u0026rsquo;17 (which was only accepted as a poster!) is already the second most cited paper in the conference\u0026rsquo;s last 5 years. I expect it could end up on spot #1 next year (only 1 citation away), as no other recent paper comes close. CHES is not listed by Google metrics at all any more, not sure why EuroSNP continues to rise quickly (+8), and has now surpassed ESORICS. It was started in \u0026lsquo;16 with great papers such as Papernot et al. 5 of the top 20 venues have a strong crypto focus, further limiting the options for general security papers to be published at. 8 out of the top 20 venues are journals, which are generally considered to be less competitive/good than tier 1 conferences by many system security researchers. Google also publishes a h5-median score, which indicates the median citation count of the publications included in the h5 computation. This somewhat gives a nice indication on how many citations you could expect for your publications in the conference, after five years. For the top 10 venues, this is between 70 and 140 (+10 compared to last year), for top 10-20 between 40 and 60 (same as last last year). Clearly, for h5 it helps to accept more papers (see Infocom rank, the journals on the list, CCS\u0026rsquo;s dominance). It would be great to award selectivity somehow, for example by dividing by number of accepted papers. Unfortunately, that information is not directly available (see here). I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of CORE ranking. Based on the h5 metric, I would consider conferences/venues with h5 \u0026gt;= 50 as tier 1, conferences with h5 \u0026gt;= 30 as tier 2, and conferences with h5 \u0026gt;= 20 as tier 3. This would put RAID and WiSec still in tier 3, but for example ASIACCS clearly in tier 2 (CORE rank: B). Such a classification disadvantages niche topics, of course.  https://secprivmeta.net/ also provides interesting analysis by topics in tier-1 security papers (unfortunately, only until 2015).

As of now, first week of January 2020, my publications reached ~2100 citations according to Google scholar (vs. ~1400 at this time last year/ 1000 two years ago/ 700 three years ago). Google scholar currently lists 72 publications (vs. 60 last year, most peer-reviewed), and one US patent. Our first GPS paper currently has 345 cites (after 257 last year). My h-index has increased to 26 (from 19), my i10-index is currently 39, from 32 last year.\n Semantic scholar lists 1375 citations and 82 publications. They still indicate how many papers were strongly influenced by my work (113), compared to 69 in previous year. Authors listed as most influenced (unclear what that means) by my work are: Aditya Mathur (66), Aanjhan Ranganathan (55), Martin Ochoa (52), Ahmad Sadeghi (51), Sridhar Adepu (51).\n Scopus lists generally lower numbers (e.g. only 58 publications, ~1065 citations), but they provide a number of co-authors: 113 (106 last year).\nOther numbers for 2019: Github lists 52 commits to repositories (after 96 in 2018), as we shifted most collaborations to use Overleaf.

This system, referred to as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where the contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user's phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server. Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user's phone. Other users' apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the device's owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data. In case the app detects a high risk, it will inform the user.","tags":["DP3T"],"title":"Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniele Antonioli","Nils Ole Tippenhauer","Kasper Rasmussen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587235028,"objectID":"6995c121e9057c6f7340fe7fa61ee898","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/publication/antonioli-20-tops/","publishdate":"2020-04-18T18:36:51.477866Z","relpermalink":"/publication/antonioli-20-tops/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Key Negotiation Downgrade Attacks on Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nils Ole Tippenhauer"],"categories":["research"],"content":"I now finished converting this page (and in particular, the ~80 news posts) to use the Hugo framework with Academic theme.

It provides a ranking of journals and conferences in different fields, and uses the h5 metric, \u0026ldquo;the number n of papers that were released in the last 5 years, and had at least n citations\u0026rdquo;.

For these tier 1 venues, this is definitely expected, as the number of submissions/accepted papers has increased significantly in the last 5 years. Usenix Security in particular increased the h5 score by 11, enough to almost reach CCS which was leader of this ranking for years (and has a larger number of accepted papers). Our ProfilIoT paper at SAC\u0026rsquo;17 (which was only accepted as a poster!) is already the top 4 cited paper in the conference\u0026rsquo;s last 5 years. I expect it could end up on spot #1 soon, as no other recent paper comes close. SOUPS, Journal of Cryptology, and FSE left the top20 (from prior position 15, 18, 19). Fast Software Encryption (FSE) is actually not listed at all any more. EuroSNP makes its first entry with h5 of 26, impressive given that the first instance was in \u0026lsquo;16. It kicked off with great papers such as Papernot et al. 7 of the top 20 venues have a strong crypto focus, further limiting the options for general security papers to be published at. Google also publishes a h5-median score, which indicates the median citation count of the publications included in the h5 computation. This somewhat gives a nice indication on how many citations you could expect for your publications in the conference, after five years. For the top 10 venues, this is between 60 and 130 (pretty close to last year), for top 10-20 between 39 and 60 (slightly lower than last year). Clearly, for h5 it helps to accept more papers (see Infocom rank, the journals on the list, CCS\u0026rsquo;s dominance). It would be great to award selectivity somehow, for example by dividing by number of accepted papers. Unfortunately, that information is not directly available (see here). Google apparently removed the classic papers listing (which was somewhat useless in my opinion). I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of CORE ranking. Based on the h5 metric, I would consider conferences/venues with h5 \u0026gt;= 50 as tier 1, conferences with h5 \u0026gt;= 30 as tier 2, and conferences with h5 \u0026gt;= 15 as tier 3. This would put RAID and WiSec still in tier 3, but for example ASIACCS clearly in tier 2 (CORE rank: B).

Google scholar currently lists 60 publications (vs. 53 last year, most peer-reviewed), and one US patent. Our first GPS paper currently has 257 cites.

This list of Normalized Top-100 Security Papers seems to be much more appropriate.\nBased on the h5 metric, the following ranking for security conferences and journals is generated here:\n ACM Symposium on Computer and Communications Security (77) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (74) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (73) USENIX Conference on Security  (70) International Conference on Cryptology (CRYPTO) (62, +1 position) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) (60,-1 position) Annual International Conference on Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT)  (53) Computers \u0026amp; Security (48) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (40) International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security (37, +1 position) International Conference on The Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (ASIACRYPT) (37, -1 position) Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) (36, +1 position) ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS) (36, +1 position) Theory of cryptography (34, -2 positions) Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (31) IEEE Security \u0026amp; Privacy (31) International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography (29) Journal of Cryptology (29) Fast Software Encryption (FSE) (29) Security and Communication Networks (29)  Some other honourable mentions where I published before, am involved, or consider submitting:\n Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (INFOCOM) (76, -4) Computer Networks (58) Annual International Conference on Mobile computing and networking (Mobicom) (49, +1 position) International Conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services (MOBISYS) (45, -1 position) International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) (33) ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) (30, but only small security track) Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) (28) European Conference on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) (28) ACM conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY) (28) International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) (25) IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) (24) Wireless Network Security (WISEC) (22) Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID) (20) International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES) (19) IFIP TC 11 International Conference on ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection (IFIP Sec) (16) Network and Systems Security (NSS) (16) Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) (15) Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm) (13) IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium, (HASE) (12) IEEE International Conferences on Internet of Things, and Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) (11) Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM) (11)  There are some interesting observations I made from the ranking (updated from last iteration):\n The h5 index of the top venues increased by about 5-9 points, without major changes in order (Crypto and NDSS swapped places). For these tier 1 venues, this is definitely expected, as the number of submissions/accepted papers has increased significantly in the last 5 years. Financial Cryptography and Data Security only increased the h5 by 1, after steep rise in the year before. ArXiv is not on Google\u0026rsquo;s list any more (I assume due to lack of peer review). The list was extended to 20 venues now. 8 of the top 20 venues have a strong crypto focus, further limiting the options for general security papers to be published at. Google also publishes a h5-median score, which indicates the median citation count of the publications included in the h5 computation. This somewhat gives a nice indication on how many citations you could expect for your publications in the conference, after five years. For the top 10 venues, this is between 60 and 130 (+20 compared to last year), for top 10-20 between 45 and 60 (like last year). Clearly, for h5 it helps to accept more papers (see Infocom rank, the journals on the list, CCS\u0026rsquo;s rising score). It would be great to award selectivity somehow, for example by dividing by number of accepted papers. Unfortunately, that information is not directly available (see here).

The latest generation even supports smart contracts – programs that are executed by all participants and that may govern everything from simple transactions to the setup of organisations. Beyond the hype, however, we find that there is little deployment beyond the two most prominent examples, Bitcoin and Ethereum. In this talk, we are going to explore some of the reasons. In particular, we show that the P2P networks that underlie blockchains impact their functionality in decisive ways. We look at dependability and abortion of transactions, both of which are crucial for enterprises, and we inspect the network structure and its influence on transaction execution. We present some early numbers from more than 2,500 scans of a blockchain network.

He will give a public talk with the title Break one link and the whole chain falls apart!: Embedding Security in Things to Cloud.\nAbstract: With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) the need and challenges of security have increased manifold. Starting from the miniature devices, which are often resource constrained, to the pervasive omni-present cloud, all avenues for a potential attack need to be mitigated. In this talk, we discuss the research activities in this direction, starting from physical security of the “things” in an IoT framework to developing dedicated cryptographic techniques for delegating data in the cloud. The talk also summarizes the research activities at the Secured Embedded Architecture Laboratory (SEAL), IIT Kharagpur, India.\nBio: Debdeep is currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Kharagpur, India and a visiting scientist at School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU-Singapore. At IIT Kharagpur he initiated the Secured Embedded Architecture Laboratory (SEAL), with a focus on Embedded Security and Side Channel Attacks. Prior to this he worked as a visiting Associate Professor of NYU-Shanghai, Assistant Professor at IIT-Madras, and as Visiting Researcher at NYU Tandon-School-of-Engineering, USA. He holds a PhD, MS, and B. Tech from IIT-Kharagpur. His research interests are Cryptography, Hardware Security, and VLSI.

It provides a ranking of journals and conferences in different fields, and uses the h5 metric, \u0026ldquo;the number n of papers that were released in the last 5 years, and had at least n citations\u0026rdquo;. Google also now added a \u0026ldquo;Classic Papers\u0026rdquo; category for papers ( link)\u0026mdash;but there was essentially nothing in that which I recognized.\nBased on the h5 metric, the following ranking for security conferences and journals is generated here:\n ACM Symposium on Computer and Communications Security (71) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (68, +1 position) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (67, -1 position) USENIX Conference on Security  (61) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) (56) International Conference on Cryptology (CRYPTO) (53) Annual International Conference on Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT)  (53) ArXiv (see discussion) Computers \u0026amp; Security (40,+4 positions) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (38) International Conference on The Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (ASIACRYPT) (36) International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security (35, not in top 15 last year) Theory of cryptography (34) Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) (33) ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS) (31)   Some other honourable mentions where I published before, am involved, or consider submitting:\n 1. Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (INFOCOM) (80) 1. Computer Networks (54) 1. International Conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services (MOBISYS) (47) 1. Annual International Conference on Mobile computing and networking (Mobicom) (45) 1. International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) (32) 1. ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) (32, but only small security track) 1. Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) (29) 1.

Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) (13) 1. Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM) (12) 1. Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm) (10)  There are some interesting observations I made from the ranking (updated from last iteration):\n 1. The h5 index of the top venues increased by about 5-9 points, with S\u0026amp;P returning to place 2. For CCS, this is definitely expected, as the number of submissions/accepted papers has increased significantly in the last 5 years. 1. Computer \u0026amp; Security joined the other two journals in the top ten list 1. Financial Cryptography and Data Security makes its first entry into top 15, probably due to Bitcoin/blockchain/smart contract related content and FinTec 1. ArXiv is in the list, but can hardly be counted as \u0026#8220;peer reviewed\u0026#8221;. 1. 5 of the top 14 venues (w/o Arxiv) have a strong crypto focus, further limiting the options for general security papers to be published at. 1. Google also publishes a h5-median score, which indicates the median citation count of the publications included in the h5 computation. This somewhat gives a nice indication on how many citations you could expect for your publications in the conference, after five years. For the top 10 venues, this is between 60 and 110, for top 10-20 between 40 and 65 1. Clearly, for h5 it helps to accept more papers (see ArXiv and Infocom rank). It would be great to award selectivity somehow, for example by dividing by number of accepted papers. Unfortunately, that information is not directly available (see here).

The paper was co-authored by Juan Guarnizo, Amit Tambe, Suman Sankar Bhunia, Martín Ochoa, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici. The paper is available here, and as pre-print on arxiv.\nFrom the abstract:\n In recent years, the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) has led to rising concerns about the security of networked embedded devices. In this work, we propose the SIPHON architecture—a Scalable high-Interaction Honeypot platform for IoT devices. Our architecture leverages IoT devices that are physically at one location and are connected to the Internet through so-called wormholes distributed around the world. The resulting architecture allows exposing few physical devices over a large number of geographically distributed IP addresses. We demonstrate the proposed architecture in a large scale experiment with 39 wormhole instances in 16 cities in 9 countries. Based on this setup, five physical IP cameras, one NVR and one IP printer are presented as 85 real IoT devices on the Internet, attracting a daily traffic of 700MB for a period of two months. A preliminary analysis of the collected traffic indicates that devices in some cities attracted significantly more traffic than others (ranging from 600 000 incoming TCP connections for the most popular destination to less than 50 000 for the least popular). We recorded over 400 brute-force login attempts to the web-interface of our devices using a total of 1826 distinct credentials, from which 11 attempts were successful. Moreover, we noted login attempts to Telnet and SSH ports some of which used credentials found in the recently disclosed Mirai malware.\n ","date":1491436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"d6853ca5ef8415b0dfbf2e20face6d3b","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/post/best-paper-award-at-cpss-17/","publishdate":"2017-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/best-paper-award-at-cpss-17/","section":"post","summary":"Our paper “SIPHON: Towards Scalable High-Interaction Physical Honeypots” won the best paper award at the 3rd ACM Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop (CPSS), co-located with AsiaCCS.","tags":[""],"title":"Best Paper award at CPSS’17","type":"post"},{"authors":["Sandra Siby","Rajib Ranjan Maiti","Nils Ole Tippenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"721a1d60c39a7debbfbf529a597a9a7b","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/publication/siby-17-iotscannershort/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T13:56:44.762329Z","relpermalink":"/publication/siby-17-iotscannershort/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"IoTScanner: Detecting Privacy Threats in IoT Neighborhoods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yair Meidan","Michael Bohadana","Asaf Shabtai","Juan-David Guarnizo","Martín Ochoa","Nils Ole Tippenhauer","Yuval Elovici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"6ae184928109766e816b9f655418ed33","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/publication/meidan-17-profiliot/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T13:56:44.761474Z","relpermalink":"/publication/meidan-17-profiliot/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ProfilIoT: A Machine Learning Approach for IoT Device Identification Based on Network Traffic Analysis (Poster)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Guarnizo","Amit Tambe","Suman Sankar Bunia","Martín Ochoa","Nils Ole Tippenhauer","Asaf Shabtai","Yuval Elovici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"31c1b2ab04b8f8b6abc05199525348b7","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/publication/guarnizo-17-siphon/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T13:56:44.762102Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guarnizo-17-siphon/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"SIPHON: Towards Scalable High-Interaction Physical Honeypots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Rocchetto","Nils Ole Tippenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"6bab5f89f84d07cdaee7571e5f05b455","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/publication/towards-17-rocchetto/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T13:56:44.761899Z","relpermalink":"/publication/towards-17-rocchetto/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Towards Formal Security Analysis of Industrial Control Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nils Ole Tippenhauer"],"categories":["service"],"content":"I am on the TPC for the Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS), and the CfP was released.

Prominent among these challenges is the establishment of trust in remote IoT devices typically attained via remote attestation, a distinct security service that aims to ascertain the current state of potentially compromised remote devices. However, recent studies have revealed many security vulnerabilities in embedded devices that are core components of the IoT. On the other hand, established protection measures for traditional computing platforms and networks may not always directly apply to IoT due to their diversity, resource constrains and large scale. In this talk we survey the landscape of the recent research on security architectures and particularly scalable remote attestation schemes for IoT devices. We also discuss their effectiveness and related tradeoffs as well as future research challenges and directions.\n ","date":1490486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"491b95e39f77416a1ff9674c7975d277","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/post/visit-by-ahmad-reza-sadeghi/","publishdate":"2017-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/visit-by-ahmad-reza-sadeghi/","section":"post","summary":"We are hosting Professor Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi from TU Darmstadt at SUTD on March 23.

The CfP was just released. More info here.\n Embedded and mobile devices that provide security and crypto functionalities, and manage private and confidential data are omnipresent in our daily lives. Examples of such devices range from smart cards and RFID tags, to mobile phones, tablets, and IoT devices. Ensuring the security and privacy of these devices is a challenging problem, as witnessed by recent breaking of crypto and security systems used in mobile phones, car keys, and RFID-enabled cards. Typical threats to extract the keys include side-channel and fault analysis. Additionally, the vulnerabilities of the devices imply also privacy concerns. The operating systems supporting some of those devices, particularly mobile phones and tablets, but also IoT ones, have become very complex. Various sorts of malware present a constant threat for users. Although measures like application sandboxing take place, they also open the court for new attacks by constantly collecting and organizing sensitive information about the user.\n  The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting novel research results on the following topics of interest:\n  – Security architectures for embedded and mobile systems\n  – Physical (side-channel and fault) attacks on embedded and mobile systems\n  – Hardware security of mobile devices\n  – (mobile) Malware detection and prevention\n  – Machine learning applications to highlight possible threats to user privacy\n  – Privacy-preserving issues for mobile devices\n  – Secure localization and location privacy for mobile devices\n  – Security and privacy in the Internet of Things\n  – Secure execution environments (e.g., TrustZone, TPMs) on mobile devices\n  – Sensor spoofing attacks\n  The one-day workshop will include presentation of peer-reviewed papers and two renowned keynote speakers, Prof. Srdjan Capkun (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) and Prof. Bart Preneel (KU Leuven, Belgium).\n  Accepted papers will be published by IEEE as the proceedings in “IEEE EuroS\u0026amp;P Workshops”.\n Important dates:\n Submission deadline: 17 December 2016 Notification: 20 January 2017 Camera-ready submission: 13 February 2017 Workshop: 30 April 2017  ","date":1480118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"1d06c1d29ddce7136bff87a6fc302cae","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/post/cfp-sems-2017/","publishdate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cfp-sems-2017/","section":"post","summary":"The Call for Papers for SEMS 2017 was just released.","tags":["cfp"],"title":"CfP: SEMS 2017","type":"post"},{"authors":["Nils Ole Tippenhauer"],"categories":["service"],"content":"I will give a keynote talk at RFIDsec, December 1, in Hong Kong.

As bibrest is using an HTTP api, it should be easy to integrate in other tools (e.g. to produce yearly reports). The RESTful part is currently limited to way the resources that are represented, and GET. I plan to add POST/PUT/PATCH in the future, but that will then also require authentication.\nIn particular, I use bibrest to provide the .bib data for the publication list on this webpage, together with the lists for individual projects (e.g., here).

It provides a ranking of journals and conferences in different fields, and uses the h5 metric, \u0026ldquo;the number n of papers that were released in the last 5 years, and had at least n citations\u0026rdquo;.\nBased on the h5 metric, the following ranking for security conferences and journals is generated here:\n ACM Symposium on Computer and Communications Security (62, +1 position) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (61, +2 positions) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (59, -2 positions) USENIX Conference on Security  (56) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) (51) International Conference on Cryptology (CRYPTO) (51) Annual International Conference on Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT)  (50) ArXiv (see discussion) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (41) Theory of cryptography (36) International Conference on The Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (ASIACRYPT) (36) Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) (33) Computers \u0026amp; Security (32) ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS) (31)  Some other honourable mentions where I published before, am involved, or consider submitting:\n Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (INFOCOM) (80) Computer Networks (50) International Conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services (MOBISYS) (46) Annual International Conference on Mobile computing and networking (Mobicom) (44) Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) (29) International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) (28) European Conference on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) (26) ACM conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY) (24) Wireless Network Security (WISEC) (22) Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID) (20) Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM) (15) IFIP TC 11 International Conference on ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection (IFIP Sec) (14) Network and Systems Security (NSS) (14) IEEE International Conferences on Internet of Things, and Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) (13) IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium, (HASE) (13)  There are some interesting observations I made from the ranking (updated from last iteration):\n Oakland lost 2 positions to CCS and the best journal (Trans. Inf. Forens. \u0026amp; Sec.). NDSS gained 4 positions (with lots of Android themed publications it seems). There are only two journals in the top ten list (like last year) ArXiv is in the list, but can hardly be counted as “peer reviewed”. 5 of the top 11 venues (w/o Arxiv) have a strong crypto focus, further limiting the options for general security papers to be published at. Google also publishes a h5-median score, which indicates the median citation count of the publications included in the h5 computation. This somewhat gives a nice indication on how many citations you could expect for your publications in the conference, after five years. For the top 10 venues, this is between 60 and 100, for top 10-20 between 40 and 50 Clearly, for h5 it helps to accept more papers (see ArXiv and Infocom rank). It would be great to award selectivity somehow, for example by dividing by number of accepted papers. Unfortunately, that information is not directly available (see here). Again, I checked for the placing of my papers in the conferences’ respective “last 5 year highscore”. My GPS paper at CCS is the venue’s top 27 paper of the last 5 years. My IFIP wireless days paper is the most cited of that venue for the last 5 years. Our Wireless signal manipulation paper is in Top 20 of Esorics.

He will give a public talk with the following details.\nTowards a Next-generation Secure Internet Architecture  The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic expectations. It permeates and intertwines with almost all aspects of our society and economy. The success of the Internet has created a dependency on communication as many of the processes underpinning the foundations of modern society would grind to a halt should communication become unavailable. However, much to our dismay, the current state of safety and availability of the Internet is far from commensurate given its importance.\n  Although we cannot conclusively determine what the impact of a 1-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, or 1-week outage of Internet connectivity on our society would be, anecdotal evidence indicates that even short outages have a profound negative impact on governmental, economic, and societal operations. To make matters worse, the Internet has not been designed for high availability in the face of malicious actions by adversaries. Recent patches to improve Internet security and availability have been constrained by the current Internet architecture, business models, and legal aspects. Moreover, there are fundamental design decisions of the current Internet that inherently complicate secure operation.\n  Given the diverse nature of constituents in today’s Internet, another important challenge is how to scale authentication of entities (e.g., AS ownership for routing, name servers for DNS, or domains for TLS) to a global environment. Currently prevalent PKI models (monopoly and oligarchy) do not scale globally because mutually distrusting entities cannot agree on a single trust root, and because everyday users cannot evaluate the trustworthiness of each of the many root CAs in their browsers.\n  To address these issues, we study the design of a next-generation Internet architecture that is secure, available, and offers privacy by design; that provides incentives for a transition to the new architecture; and that considers economic and policy issues at the design stage. Such a research environment offers a bonanza for security researchers: a critically important problem space with a medley of challenges to address, and unfettered freedom to think creatively in the absence of limiting constraints. Once we know how good a network could be, we can then engage in incorporating these ideas into the current Internet or study strategies for transition to a next-generation network.\n  Date: May 11 2016 Time: 2:30pm to 3:30pm Place: LT5  ","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576691977,"objectID":"22b0b106597ed3e6cdd8ae47e0537e32","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/post/visit-by-adrian-perrig/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/visit-by-adrian-perrig/","section":"post","summary":"I’m hosting Prof. Adrian Perrig from ETH Zurich at SUTD on May 11 2016.

Now, you should be able to compile this to slides by using “C-C C-e l O” Emacs magic.

I normally use the “\u0026lt;2-\u0026gt;” style animations to put additional bullet points or answers to questions on a slide. The additional text will be invisible at the beginning, but still influence the layout. The “only” style animations do not consider the later content in the first layout, so it is not as useful for text. I use it exclusively to do “manual” animations of figures. For that, I draw each animation step separately (in Inkscape), and exchange the images on each slide.\nI use separate blocks for each. In my theme, the standard block actually has same colors as background, so it is invisible. You generate block code by starting a new heading (without title) with ***, and then using C-C C-B b. I then manually add the BEAMER_act line into the block header.\nUncover example:\n- This will be displayed first *** :B_block: :PROPERTIES: :BEAMER_env: block :BEAMER_act: \u0026lt;2-\u0026gt; :END: - Then this will appear on the second animation slide  Beamer-style “only” is also possible, by using a block like this:\n- This will be displayed first *** :B_block: :PROPERTIES: :BEAMER_env: onlyenv :BEAMER_ACT: \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; :END: - Then this will appear on the second animation slide  To export the onlyenv, you need to add the following to your .emacs:\n;; only env for org-mode beamer (add-to-list 'org-beamer-environments-extra '(\u0026quot;onlyenv\u0026quot; \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\\\\begin{onlyenv}%a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\\\\end{onlyenv}\u0026quot;))  ","date":1453852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588439219,"objectID":"3139e49010ff1442b70d51e4feccc2e6","permalink":"https://tippenhauer.de/post/writing-presentations-in-org-mode-markup/","publishdate":"2016-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/writing-presentations-in-org-mode-markup/","section":"post","summary":"For two years now, I am almost exclusively using the toolchain of org-mode+emacs+beamer+pdflatex to prepare my presentations for conferences and lectures.

It provides a ranking of journals and conferences in different fields, and uses the h5 metric, \u0026ldquo;the number n of papers that were released in the last 5 years, and had at least n citations\u0026rdquo;.\nBased on the h5 metric, the following ranking for security conferences and journals is generated here:\n IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (58) ACM Symposium on Computer and Communications Security (58) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security  (55) USENIX Conference on Security  (50) Conference on Advances in cryptology (CRYPTO) 49 Annual International Conference on Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT)  (48) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (48) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) (44) ArXiv (see discussion) International Conference on The Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (ASIACRYPT) (35)  Some other honorable mentions where I published before:\n European Conference on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) (24) Wireless Network Security (WISEC) (22) International Conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services (MOBICOM) (49)  There are some interesting observations I made from the ranking:\n Oakland and CCS are ranked higher than the best journal (Trans. Inf. Forens. \u0026amp; Sec.) There are only two journals in the top ten list. ArXiv is in the list, but can hardly be counted as “peer reviewed”. Several of the top 20 items have a strong crypto focus, further limiting the options for general security papers to be published at Google also publishes a h5-median score, which indicates the median citation count of the publications included in the h5 computation. This somewhat gives a nice indication on how many citations you could expect for your publications in the conference, after five years. For the top 10 venues, this is between 70 and 100, for top 10-20 between 40 and 70 Clearly, for h5 it helps to accept more papers (see ArXiv rank). It would be great to award selectivity somehow. Based on the Google Metrics page, it is now easily possible to find how well a publication performed relatively to other publications at the same venue. I found it interesting to check for some of my publications (e.g. my GPS paper at CCS is within the Top40 papers of the last 5 years). My paper at the Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication is the top 3 most cited in the last 5 years.  Related rankings References to related rankings: LIPN, A*STAR. LIPN ranking of security conferences: CCS (A*), Advances in Crypto (A*), EUROCRYPT (A*), ACSAC (A), ASIACRYPT (A), CSF (A), ESORICS (A), Financial Cryptography (A), NDSS (A), S\u0026amp;P(A), SecureCom (A), Usenix Sec (A), AsiaCCS (B), IFIP Security (B)\nMost other security conferences of level B or lower are not known to me, level C includes a lot of workshops as well.
