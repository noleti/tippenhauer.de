      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am involved in designing SUTD’s upcoming Masters’ in Security by Design (MSSD) Program. This will be ISTD’s first Masters’ program, the start is scheduled to be in September 2017. Applications can be submitted now on our website linked above. About the program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSSD programme is one-of-a-kind in that it focuses on bringing cybersecurity at the design stage of critical infrastructure and enterprise networks. This focus enables the training of a special type of engineer who can not only contribute to the security of organizations that do online business, but also to the security of large scale public infrastructures such as power grid, water treatment and distribution, transportation, and oil and natural gas processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.sutd.edu.sg/~martin_ochoa/&#34;&gt;Martin Ochoa&lt;/a&gt;, I founded SUTD’s first CTF team Kopipacket in January 2016. While we were pretty busy with other &lt;a href=&#34;https://tippenhauer.de/scy-phy-systems-week-2016/&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; for most of the summer, we still managed to participate in 12 CTF events (with placements between 11th and 893rd). Overall, we end the year on place 209 of the global CTF team &lt;a href=&#34;https://ctftime.org/team/21875&#34;&gt;leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;. In Singapore, we placed third (behind narwhals (126) and greyhats (157)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still looking for interested players – ideally from SUTD, but we also welcome outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tippenhauer.de/post/cfp-wisec-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on the TPC for WiSec, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wisec2017.ccs.neu.edu/call-for-papers-posters-demos.html&#34;&gt;call for papers&lt;/a&gt; has been released:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACM WiSec is the leading ACM and SIGSAC conference dedicated to all aspects of security and privacy in wireless and mobile networks and their applications. In addition to the traditional ACM WiSec topics of physical, link, and network layer security, we welcome papers focusing on the security and privacy of mobile software platforms, usable security and privacy, biometrics, cryptography, and the increasingly diverse range of mobile or wireless applications such as Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems. The conference welcomes both theoretical as well as systems contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, there are a couple of interesting formats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full and short papers (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; pages ACM format)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opinion papers (3 pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproducibility label (for results reproduced by third party)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WiSec also solicits submission of posters and demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract submission: March 13, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CfP: SEMS 2017</title>
      <link>https://tippenhauer.de/post/cfp-sems-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tippenhauer.de/post/cfp-sems-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on the TPC of SEMS 2017, held in between with IEEE S&amp;amp;P and EUROCRYPT 2017 in Paris. The CfP was just released. More info &lt;a href=&#34;http://sems2017.cs.ru.nl/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded and mobile devices that provide security and crypto functionalities, and manage private and confidential data are omnipresent in our daily lives. Examples of such devices range from smart cards and RFID tags, to mobile phones, tablets, and IoT devices. Ensuring the security and privacy of these devices is a challenging problem, as witnessed by recent breaking of crypto and security systems used in mobile phones, car keys, and RFID-enabled cards. Typical threats to extract the keys include side-channel and fault analysis. Additionally, the vulnerabilities of the devices imply also privacy concerns. The operating systems supporting some of those devices, particularly mobile phones and tablets, but also IoT ones, have become very complex. Various sorts of malware present a constant threat for users. Although measures like application sandboxing take place, they also open the court for new attacks by constantly collecting and organizing sensitive information about the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting novel research results on the following topics of interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Security architectures for embedded and mobile systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Physical (side-channel and fault) attacks on embedded and mobile systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Hardware security of mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– (mobile) Malware detection and prevention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Machine learning applications to highlight possible threats to user privacy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Privacy-preserving issues for mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Secure localization and location privacy for mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Security and privacy in the Internet of Things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Secure execution environments (e.g., TrustZone, TPMs) on mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Sensor spoofing attacks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one-day workshop will include presentation of peer-reviewed papers and two renowned keynote speakers, Prof. Srdjan Capkun (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) and Prof. Bart Preneel (KU Leuven, Belgium).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepted papers will be published by IEEE as the proceedings in “IEEE EuroS&amp;amp;P Workshops”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important dates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submission deadline: 17 December 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notification: 20 January 2017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera-ready submission: 13 February 2017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop: 30 April 2017&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on the TPC for the 12th Workshop on RFID and IoT Security (RFIDsec) 2016, and the call for papers was just released. Submission Date is 12 September 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started in 2005, RFIDsec has become the premier venue devoted to security and privacy of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The nature of radio-enabled item identification and automatic data capture has significantly changed overthe years driven by the interest in overarching applications such as the Internet-of-Things and cyber-physical systems. As such, RFIDsec has also broadened its scope and seeks papers describing any contributions to security and privacy in any application area related to any constrained wireless devices, such as sensor nodes, smart wearables, contactless smart cards, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and RFID tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>SUTD Beamer Theme</title>
      <link>https://tippenhauer.de/post/sutd-beamer-theme/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tippenhauer.de/post/sutd-beamer-theme/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For teaching and other presentations, I tend to use LaTeX+ beamer. Unfortunately, the default beamer themes are in my opinion all somewhat overloaded and outdated. I spent some time to built two themes for personal use, I call them the SUTD light and SUTD dark theme. The light theme is black font on light grey background, with maroon highlights. The dark theme is white text on dark grey background, with maroon highlights. The main focus is on simplicity – putting only a minimal amount of information on each slide, without wasting space. By default, both themes also include the SUTD logo. The following is an example of a title slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;slide0.png&#34; alt=&#34;slide0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, showing the different bullet point levels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;slide1.png&#34; alt=&#34;slide1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And an example of the dark theme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;slide2.png&#34; alt=&#34;slide2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following information is put automatically in header/footer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide title (header)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Author name (footer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk title (footer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date (footer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page number (footer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scy-phy/public/tree/master/themeSUTD&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I am looking forward to comments and feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
